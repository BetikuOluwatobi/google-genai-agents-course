    "# Agent Observability - Plugins\n",
    " \n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn:\n",
    "- How to develop the LoggingPlugin to add observability to an agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Agent Observability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚨 The challenge:** Unlike traditional code, AI Agents are probabilistic—they might run perfectly five times and crash on the sixth because the LLM decided to format a date differently or \"hallucinated\" a parameter. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Book a flight to Paris for next Friday.\"\n",
    "Agent (Internal Tool Call): book_flight(title=\"flight\", date=\"next Friday\")\n",
    "System Response: ERROR: 400 Bad Request. Invalid format for 'date'. Expected YYYY-MM-DD, received 'next Friday'.\n",
    "Agent (to User): \"I'm sorry, I encountered a technical error and couldn't book the flight. Please try again later.\"\n",
    "You: 😭 WHY?? Is it the prompt? Missing tools? API error?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 The Solution:** Agent observability with ADK Logger Plugin gives you complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process. This plugin will hook into the agent's execution lifecycle phase to log exactly what prompts are sent to the LLM, which tools are available, how the model responds, and where failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DEBUG Log: LLM Request shows System Response: ERROR: 400 Bad Request. Invalid format for 'date'. Expected YYYY-MM-DD, received 'next Friday'.\n",
    "You: 🎯 Aha! Wrong date format - easy fix!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ADK Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "ADK Plugins are a mechanism for implementing logic that intercepts, modifies, and even controls the agent's execution lifecycle. The plugin is composed of callback hooks, which are specific methods in your Plugin class that you can implement to run code at a key moment. You have a choice between two modes of operation based on your hook's return value:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To Observe: Implement a hook with no return value (None). This approach is for tasks such as logging or collecting metrics, as it allows the agent's workflow to proceed to the next step without interruption. For example, you could use after_tool_callback in a Plugin to log every tool's result for debugging.\n",
    "- To Intervene: Implement a hook and return a value. This approach short-circuits the workflow. The Runner halts processing, skips any subsequent plugins and the original intended action, like a Model call, and use a Plugin callback's return value as the result. A common use case is implementing before_model_callback to return a cached LlmResponse, preventing a redundant and costly API call.\n",
    "- To Amend: Implement a hook and modify the Context object. This approach allows you to modify the context data for the module to be executed without otherwise interrupting the execution of that module. For example, adding additional, standardized prompt text for Model object execution.\n",

    "### 📝 Key Insights: The `LoggingPlugin` Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LoggingPlugin` class demonstrated above serves as a comprehensive **observability layer** for the Google ADK agent. Instead of scattering `print()` statements throughout the business logic, this plugin centralizes monitoring by leveraging ADK's **Lifecycle Callbacks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of how it enhances the agent's robustness:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Full Observability (The \"Black Box\" Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Agents are often \"black boxes\", inputs go in, and answers come out, but the intermediate reasoning is lost. This plugin utilizes the `BasePlugin` inheritance to hook into every critical stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lifecycle Hooks:** It tracks the macro-flow (`before_run`, `after_run`) to measure total execution time per session.\n",
    "* **Decision Hooks:** It tracks the micro-flow (`before_model`, `after_model`) to see exactly what the LLM \"thought\" before acting.\n",
    "* **Action Hooks:** It tracks tool usage (`before_tool`, `after_tool`) to verify that the agent is passing the correct arguments to your APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Tiered Logging Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements a disciplined logging hierarchy that separates \"operational noise\" from \"critical signals\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`INFO`**: Used for high-level flow (e.g., *“Agent Started,”* *“Tool Called”*). This is safe for production logs.\n",
    "* **`DEBUG`**: Used for heavy data payloads (e.g., *Full JSON arguments, raw prompt text*). This is essential for development, but should be disabled in production to save storage.\n",
    "* **`WARNING`**: Flags potential configuration issues, such as an agent defined with no tools (`before_model_callback`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Cost & Performance Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `after_model_callback`, the plugin explicitly extracts `usage_metadata`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "in_tokens = usage.prompt_token_count\n",
    "out_tokens = usage.candidates_token_count\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is critical for **FinOps**. It allows you to calculate the exact cost of every interaction and identify expensive queries or inefficient prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Defensive Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The plugin acts as a safety net. In the `on_model_error_callback`, rather than letting the application crash if the LLM is unreachable, it intercepts the exception and returns a fallback message:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Sorry, I'm currently having trouble connecting to my brain...\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the user experience remains smooth even during backend failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Context Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how almost every log includes `invocation_context.session.id`. In a production environment with thousands of concurrent users, this ID allows you to filter logs and reconstruct a single conversation thread across distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Pro Tip for Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "When adding this to your `Runner`, you can pass a custom logger instance. This allows you to route these specific agent logs to a separate file or a cloud monitoring service (like Google Cloud Logging) without interfering with your standard application logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example Usage in Notebook\n",
    "my_logger = logging.getLogger(\"agent_debugger\")\n",
    "plugin = LoggingPlugin(logger=my_logger)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Plugin callback functions have precedence over callbacks implemented at the object level. This behavior means that Any Plugin callbacks code is executed before any Agent, Model, or tool object callbacks are executed. Furthermore, if a Plugin-level agent callback returns any value, and not an empty (None) response, the Agent, Model, or Tool-level callback is not executed (skipped). Read more about Plugin hooks [here](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/plugins/#plugin-callback-hooks)."
